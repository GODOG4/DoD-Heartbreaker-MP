# DoD-Heartbreaker-MP

Based off of ShortHills IGoRDoD: https://github.com/TheShortHills/IGoRDoD which has the destinction of being the first person who realized that trying to remove the rot of HPM from DoD is a futile task. Instead he just build off of IGOR-PUIR

This mod attempts to capture the feel of a more proper DoD though: added back many countries and paths missing from IGoRDoD and adjusted borders to be closer to your run of the mill DoD.

Additionally several other changes have been made in the spirit of Retvrn to Tradition:

* Added back the spread out Anglois Pops in Normandy and Southern England, as God intended before Zombiefreak cruelly genocided them.
* Ported over pop files where they made sense to restore pop diversity across the world where there should be.
* Nerfed Germany to 38 LR however Bohemia and Silesia are 38 LR now as well, added several important German Cities which will have 40.
* Reworked how Dual Monarchy works: They now start with 32 LR across their entire nation. Depending on the path they choose this can be improved to 35. (French path only French Cores, Dual Path you have to wait until 1870 but get both English and French cores to 35, English path you get English and Irish cores buffed) Paths can only be chosen in 1840, although the above Anglois changes means you'll have at least 3.3 million for mobilisation for the first few wars.
* For the above, some decisions like coring Ireland as Scandinavia, Coming Home as Beornia, or coring France as Burgundy will buff the LR up as well, although it will only buff them to 35 so this is just to prevent Dual Monarchy from spite picking a path to deny LR.
* Arcadia gets the South_American_Immigrant_Nation flag when they form, meaning they'll get immigrants year-round like USA in PUIR. As a counter if Gran Colombia manages to annex all of Plantagenias cores and prevent Arcadia from ever forming they get that buff instead.
* Added back in Spain's war with GC and added decisions to annex the resulting puppets: Hispanic Commonwealth is now back in fashion and better than ever thanks to split immigration! (There's no tag change though since you already have to tag switch to Iberia to get Catalan)
* Adjusted Region borders to be closer to how they are in proper DoD in certain places (mostly Arcadia).
